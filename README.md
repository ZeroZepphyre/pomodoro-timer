# pomodoro-timer
A timer for the "Pomodoro Study Stragegy", wich consists of several "work" segments followed by short rests.
The timer does one full Pomodoro (four 25 minute "work" segments, three 5 minute rests and a 25 minute rest) then resets. 
Whenever a work segment ends, a checker mark is displayed underneath the timer.
